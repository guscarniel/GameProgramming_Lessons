# Instances and Status
This collection got one script that instantiate a bullet (Prefab) and AddForce to it, than wait and destroy itself.
Another script (DestroyBullet) takes the bullet tag to determine a collision it will be destroyed.
The last one is a MovePosition with an Enumerator to change status.
