# Instances and Enumerator
This collection got one script for instantiate a bullet (prefab) and boost it with AddForce. After some seconds the bullet will be destroyed.
The DestroyBullet script compares the bullet tag to determine if a collision has happened.
The last script is a MovePosition with an Enumerator collection of custom status. They will change whenever the player touch a game object.
