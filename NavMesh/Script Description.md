# NavMesh
NavMeshAI sets the objective which is a vector3 position, and the agent finds the closest path to get there.
NavMeshPointClick determines the agent's objective by the raycast hit.
On AI > Navigation > Areas you can set how hard the object is to transpass when comparing to other areas. So the agent is more likely to follow a clear path.
